WSIB claims 

The project looks at three different types of claims made to the WSIB between the years 2011 - 2019.

Data files were obtained from the WSIB by the numbers (https://www.wsib.ca/en/bythenumbers).  Three reports were generated, one for each type of claim:
No Lost Time (no_lost_time.csv), Lost Time (lost_time.csv), and Fatalities (fatalities.csv) for the years 2011 to 2019.

For each file the following filters were applied on the "Report Builder":
Injury/Illness year --> 2011-2019
Industry Sector --> all except Schedule 2 and Unknown
Age --> all except NA
Gender --> all except NA

R code was used to prepare the data.  The code in the DataPrep.rmd file reads each data file, collapses the "Year" column, combines the files via inner join, checks for NA values and writes the end result.  Two files were written as a result; file contatining all three types of claims (No lost time, lost time and fatality) as well as a file containing only the non-fatal claims (No lost time, lost time).
