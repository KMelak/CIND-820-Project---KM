WSIB CLAIMS PROJECT

INTRODUCTION

The project looks at three different types of claims made to the WSIB between the years 2011 - 2019.  The Method Diagram file outlines the applied techniques.

Data files were obtained from the WSIB by the Numbers portal (https://www.wsib.ca/en/bythenumbers).  Three reports were generated, one for each type of claim:
No Lost Time (no_lost_time.csv), Lost Time (lost_time.csv), and Fatalities (fatalities.csv) for the years 2011 to 2019.

For each report the following filters were applied on the "Report Builder":
Injury/Illness year --> 2011-2019
Industry Sector --> all except Schedule 2 and Unknown
Age --> all except NA
Gender --> all except NA

An additional file containing the NAICS codes for each industy is also included.

DATA PREPARATION
R code was used to prepare the data.  The code in the DataPrep.rmd file reads each data file, collapses the "Year" column, combines the files via inner join, checks for NA values and writes the end result.  Two files were written as a result; file contatining all three types of claims WSIB_data.csv (No lost time, lost time and fatality) as well as a file containing only the non-fatal claims WSIB_no_fat.csv (No lost time, lost time).

EDA
The Exploratory Data Analysis report was prepared using Python.  Code for this portion is included in EDA.ipynb. 
The ProfileReport using the pandas package was prepared as WSIB_Profile_Report.
Similarily to the data files, an additional profile report was created for the data containing only non-fatal claims --> WSIB_no_fat_Profile_Report.
